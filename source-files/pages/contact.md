# Contacting The Project

If you are looking for assistance configuring or using any of our projects, you
should:

* Visit the project page and see if there is an IRC channel or "Issues" page
  that is suited for your needs.
* Visit
  [#Terminus-Project on Freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net/Terminus-Project) and
  ask for support there. You may be redirected to a more appropriate channel.

If you are looking to discuss the Terminus Project as a whole, or would like to
discuss consulting or contracting possibilities, please email the project head,
[Kyle Johnson <kyle@vacantminded.com>](mailto:kyle@vacantminded.com). If you do
not hear back within 48 hours, try visiting our project IRC channel, as it is
possible your message may have been eaten by the spam filter.
