## Terminus-Bot

Written in Ruby, Terminus-Bot provides a highly extensible IRC bot application
with an easy-to-use scripting API. Adding interactive commands can be as simple
as just a couple of lines of easy-to-read code.

Terminus-Bot has been designed with speed and security in mind. Keeping up with
modern and changing standards such as [IRCv3](http://ircv3.org/) is another
area that we give a lot of attention. Many aging IRC projects are falling
behind, and we feel that Terminus-Bot can fill the gap.

## Other Projects

We are currently planning several other projects with wider applications than
our existing IRC bot. Check back here for more information, or watch
[our GitHub organization](https://github.com/Terminus-Project) for updates.
